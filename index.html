                <div class="bodycardtext">Vermont is home to tens of thousands of men and women who engage in hunting and other outdoor recreational activities throughout all times of the year. On most occasions, these people are carrying rifles and shotguns with the intent of tagging a deer or a bear. While hunting is statistically a safe activity, there are many examples of life-altering hunting accidents taking place in Vermont. </div>
