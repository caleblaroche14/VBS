The wooden posts are typically placed on the road-facing boundaries of the parcel and are set two feet in the ground and are secured using tamped gravel or, in some cases, concrete. Aluminum or poly signs are affixed to the posts and signature and year validation stickers are attached. Second Tier packages offer the presentation of the most premium package while maintaining a utilitarian look for the remainder of the property.

The posts are set two feet in the ground and are secured using tamped gravel or concrete. The signage is aluminum with property and contact information printed directly onto the sign. Signature and year validation stickers are affixed to the signs. The wooden posts are treated with weatherproof stain after a curing period to extend the life of the posts. All Third Tier packages include re-validation of the signage and re-registration of the parcel one year after the initial service. </div>
